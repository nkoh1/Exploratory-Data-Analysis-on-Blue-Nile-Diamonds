# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Blue-Nile-Diamonds
First group project of STAT6021 - Linear Models for Data Science at the University of Virginia.

The objective of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis using the 'diamonds.csv' file provided by Blue Nile, a jewelry retailer, to determine if the claims on their website match what the data suggests. The group then applied transformation techniques such as Box Cox Transformation to find additional insights that might have been missed with linear regression alone.
